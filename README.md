## Scientific Heritage & The "Light" Principle

> *"Light doesn't choose the shortest path... it chooses the fastest."*

EDMRN is built on the philosophy of **Fermat's Principle of Least Time**. While the galaxy is vast, navigation is an optimization problem. To solve this, EDMRN utilizes a custom-reimplemented version of the **Lin-Kernighan (LK) Algorithm**.

### The Minds Behind the Logic:
- **Brian Kernighan (1942-)**: A living legend of computer science (co-creator of C, Unix, and AWK). His work at Bell Labs laid the foundation for the efficiency you see in EDMRN today.
- **Shen Lin (1932-2017)**: The mathematical genius who, alongside Kernighan, solved the TSP complexity with the variable n-opt heuristic.

In version 3.2.0, this engine is more refined than ever, allowing 500+ system routes to be optimized in seconds on modern CPUs like the Ryzen 9, while maintaining minimal system overhead.

### Performance Tips

- Close other applications during route optimization
- Use SSD for better file I/O performance
- Disable antivirus real-time scanning for EDMRN folder
- Keep only necessary tabs open
- Clear old backups periodically to save space

### Antivirus False Positives
Some antivirus software may flag EDMRN.exe (common with PyInstaller-built apps):

 **Safe Options:**

1. Add EDMRN folder to antivirus exceptions
2. Run from source code instead of executable
3. Check [https://www.virustotal.com/](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/0574687e50946876e88e695f7e67a447d6969a372014645b8e4b0205c90fc152) for verification
4. Download only from official GitHub releases

- ✅ Creates overlay window for in-game display
- ✅ Copies system names to clipboard (manual paste, user-initiated)
- ✅ Checks GitHub for updates (version comparison only)
- ✅ Makes API calls to EDSM/Spansh (system data, route calculations)

### ❌ What EDMRN Does NOT Do:

- ❌ No telemetry or analytics collection
- ❌ No personal information access or storage
- ❌ No game memory manipulation or injection
- ❌ No automated keyboard/mouse input
- ❌ No data sharing with third parties
- ❌ No online account required
- ❌ No background processes when closed

### 🔒 Data Storage

All data stored locally on your PC:

-  **Route Data**: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\EDMRN_Route_Data\`
-  **Backups**: `EDMRN_Route_Data\backups\`
-  **Logs**: `EDMRN_Route_Data\logs\`
-  **Settings**: `EDMRN_Route_Data\settings.json`

**No cloud storage. No remote access. Your data stays yours.**

### Antivirus False Positives

PyInstaller-built executables sometimes trigger false positives:

**Why this happens:**

- PyInstaller bundles Python interpreter
- Some AV heuristics flag unknown executables
- EDMRN is new and not widely distributed yet

  

**Verification Steps:**

1. ✅ Download only from official [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/NinurtaKalhu/Elite-Dangerous-Multi-Route-Optimizer/releases)
2. ✅ Check file hash against release notes
3. ✅ Scan with [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/0574687e50946876e88e695f7e67a447d6969a372014645b8e4b0205c90fc152)
4. ✅ Run from source if concerned (see installation)

**Safe Actions:**

- Add EDMRN folder to antivirus exceptions
- Use Windows Defender SmartScreen "Run anyway"
- Report false positive to your AV vendor
